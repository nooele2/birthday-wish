          <em>
            Di Di is an angel because she brings light into every moment, even the ones that feel heavy.
            She has this way of making you feel seen and heard, like you're the most important person in
            the world when she looks at you. Her kindness isn't just something she shows—it's part of who
            she is, woven into every laugh, every hug, every thoughtful word. She's the kind of person who
            lifts others without even trying, just by being herself. And honestly, if angels walk among us,
            there's no doubt Di Di is one of them.
